# AI Case Study of Credo Health Solutions, Inc.

## Overview and Origin
Credo Health Solutions, Inc. (Credo Health) is a privately held, venture-capital-backed start-up in the healthcare industry[^1]. It was incorporated in 2021 in Denver, CO, by Carm Huntress[^1] [^2].

Credo Health aims to automate the patient medical record retrieval process for healthcare providers[^3].

Credo Health has gone through two rounds of seed funding for a total of $8.25 million from 8 investors ($3 million in March of 2022 and $5.25 million in January of 2024)[^1] [^2]. The company has grown from 6 employees to 24 employees between March of 2022 and January of 2024[^1] [^2].

According to the company's blog[^4], Carm Huntress was inspired by his mother who carried stacks of her patient records with her from medical appointment to medical appointment when she was ill with cancer in the early to mid 1990.

## Business Activities

Although medical patient records are mostly digitized in Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, in many instances, these records are still exchanged via Fax or email between healthcare providers[^5]. In addition, the information contained in these often voluminous records are not synthesized before consumption by the receiving provider[^5].

Some of the inefficiences caused by this lack of interoperability are
* Delay in patient care due to incomplete patient medical records[^6].
* Administrative overhead due to "chart chasing"[^3].
* Repeated diagnostic tests because records of previous tests could not be found[^4].
* Incomplete coding of patients medical conditions which causes lost revenue for at-risk Medicare Advantage providers.

Credo Health aims to solve these problems by
1. Automating the retrieval of patient records.
2. Converting all records into machine readable format.
3. Applying AI to synthesize the data.
4. Making all the data available in the EHR of the treating provider.
